## Prototypal Inheritance

In addition to supporting ES2015 classes, CoffeeScript provides a few shortcuts for working with prototypes. The `extends` operator can be used to create an inheritance chain between any pair of constructor functions, and `::` gives you quick access to an objectâ€™s prototype:

```
codeFor('prototypes', '"one_two".dasherize()')
```
