## Breaking Changes From CoffeeScript 1.x to 2

CoffeeScript 2 aims to output as much idiomatic ES2015+ syntax as possible with as few breaking changes from CoffeeScript 1.x as possible. Some breaking changes, unfortunately, were unavoidable.

<section id="breaking-changes-default-values">

### Default values for function parameters and destructured elements

Per the [ES2015 spec regarding function default parameters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Default_parameters) and [destructuring default values](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment#Default_values), default values are only applied when a value is missing or `undefined`. In CoffeeScript 1.x, the default value would be applied in those cases but also if the  value was `null`.

```
codeFor('breaking_change_function_parameter_default_values', 'f(null)')
```

```
codeFor('breaking_change_destructuring_default_values', 'a')
```

### Bound generator functions

Bound generator functions, a.k.a. generator arrow functions, [aren’t allowed in ECMAScript](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27661306/can-i-use-es6s-arrow-function-syntax-with-generators-arrow-notation). You can write `function*` or `=>`, but not both. Therefore, CoffeeScript code like this:

```coffee
f = => yield this
# Throws a compiler error
```

Needs to be rewritten the old-fashioned way:

```
codeFor('breaking_change_bound_generator_function')
```

<section id="breaking-changes-classes">

### Classes are compiled to ES2015 classes

ES2015 classes and their methods have some restrictions beyond those on regular functions.

Class constructors can’t be invoked without `new`:

```coffee
(class)()
# Throws a TypeError at runtime
```

Derived (extended) class `constructor`s cannot use `this` before calling `super`:

```coffee
class B extends A
  constructor: -> this
  # Throws a compiler error
```

Class methods can’t be used with `new` (uncommon):

```coffee
class Namespace
  @Klass = ->
new Namespace.Klass
# Throws a TypeError at runtime
```

<section id="breaking-changes-bare-super">

### Bare `super`

Due to a syntax clash with `super` with accessors, bare `super` no longer compiles to a super call forwarding all arguments.

```coffee
class B extends A
  foo: -> super
  # Throws a compiler error
```

Arguments can be forwarded explicitly using splats:

```
codeFor('breaking_change_super_with_arguments')
```

Or if you know that the parent function doesn’t require arguments, just call `super()`:

```
codeFor('breaking_change_super_without_arguments')
```

</section>
<section id="breaking-changes-super-in-non-class-methods">

### `super` in non-class methods

In CoffeeScript 1.x it is possible to use `super` in more than just class methods, such as in manually prototype-assigned functions:

```coffee
A = ->
B = ->
B extends A
B.prototype.foo = -> super arguments...
# Throws a compiler error
```

Due to the switch to ES2015 `super`, this is no longer supported. The above case could be refactored to:

```
codeFor('breaking_change_super_in_non-class_methods_refactor_with_apply')
```

or

```
codeFor('breaking_change_super_in_non-class_methods_refactor_with_class')
```

<section id="breaking-changes-dynamic-class-keys-exclude-executable-class-scope">

### Dynamic class keys exclude executable class scope

Due to the hoisting required to compile to ES2015 classes, dynamic keys in class methods can’t use values from the executable class body unless the methods are assigned in prototype style.

```coffee
class A
  name = 'method'
  "#{name}": ->   # This method will be named 'undefined'
  @::[name] = ->  # This will work; assigns to `A.prototype.method`
```

### Literate CoffeeScript now parsed by a Markdown library

The CoffeeScript 1.x implementation of Literate CoffeeScript relies on indentation to tell apart code blocks from documentation, and as such it can get confused by Markdown features that also use indentation like lists. In CoffeeScript 2 this has been refactored to now use [Markdown-It](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it) to detect Markdown sections rather than just looking at indentation. The only significant difference is that now if you want to include a code block in documentation, as opposed to the compiler recognizing that code block as code, it must have at least one line fully unindented. Wrapping it in HTML tags is no longer sufficient.

Code blocks interspersed with lists may need to be refactored. In general, code blocks should be separated by a blank line between documentation, and should maintain a consistent indentation level—so an indentation of one tab (or whatever you consider to be a tab stop, like 2 spaces or 4 spaces) should be treated as your code’s “left margin,” with all code in the file relative to that column.
