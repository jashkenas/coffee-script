### Argument parsing and shebang lines

#### Trailing `--`

Previous versions of CoffeeScript required a `--` after the script to run, but this convention is now deprecated. The new standard is described in the output of `coffee -h`:

``` bash
> coffee -h

Usage: coffee [options] [--] path/to/script.coffee [args]

If called without options, `coffee` will run your script.

  -b, --bare         compile without a top-level function wrapper
  -c, --compile      compile to JavaScript and save as .js files
  -e, --eval         pass a string from the command line as input
  -h, --help         display this help message
  -i, --interactive  run an interactive CoffeeScript REPL
  -j, --join         concatenate the source CoffeeScript before compiling
  -m, --map          generate source map and save as .js.map files
  -M, --inline-map   generate source map and include it directly in output
  -n, --nodes        print out the parse tree that the parser produces
      --nodejs       pass options directly to the "node" binary
      --no-header    suppress the "Generated by" header
  -o, --output       set the output directory for compiled JavaScript
  -p, --print        print out the compiled JavaScript
  -r, --require      require the given module before eval or REPL
  -s, --stdio        listen for and compile scripts over stdio
  -l, --literate     treat stdio as literate style coffeescript
  -t, --tokens       print out the tokens that the lexer/rewriter produce
  -v, --version      display the version number
  -w, --watch        watch scripts for changes and rerun commands

```

If the script is run with a `--` after the script, it will show a warning, then run your script.

``` bash
> coffee path/to/script.coffee --
coffee was invoked with '--' as the second positional argument, which is
now deprecated. To pass '--' as an argument to a script to run, put an
additional '--' before the path to your script.

'--' will be removed from the argument list.
The positional arguments were: ["path/to/script.coffee","--"]
...
```

#### Shebang scripts

On non-Windows platforms, a `.coffee` file can be made executable by adding a shebang (`#!`) line at the top of the file and marking the file as executable. For example:

`executable-script.coffee`:
``` coffeescript
#!/usr/bin/env coffee

x = 2 + 2
console.log x
```

``` bash
> chmod +x ./executable-script.coffee
> ./executable-script.coffee
4
```

Due to a bug in the argument parsing of previous CoffeeScript versions, this used to fail when trying to pass arguments to the script. Some users on OS X worked around the problem by using `#!/usr/bin/env coffee --` at the top of the file instead. However, that wonâ€™t work on Linux, which cannot parse shebang lines with more than a single argument. While these scripts will still run on OSX, CoffeeScript will now display a warning before compiling or evaluating files that begin with a too-long shebang line:

`invalid-executable-script.coffee`:
``` coffeescript
#!/usr/bin/env coffee --

x = 2 + 2
console.log x
```

``` bash
> chmod +x /path/to/invalid-executable-script.coffee
> /path/to/invalid-executable-script.coffee
The script to be run begins with a shebang line with more than one
argument. This script will fail on platforms such as Linux which only
allow a single argument.
The shebang line was: '#!/usr/bin/env coffee --' in file '/path/to/invalid-executable-script.coffee'
The arguments were: ["coffee","--"]
4
```

Note that the script *is* still run, producing the `4` at the bottom.
