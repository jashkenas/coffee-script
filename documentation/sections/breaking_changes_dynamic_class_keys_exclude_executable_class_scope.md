### Dynamic class keys exclude executable class scope

Due to the hoisting required to compile to ES2015 classes, dynamic keys in class methods canâ€™t use values from the executable class body unless the methods are assigned in prototype style.

```coffee
class A
  name = 'method'
  "#{name}": ->   # This method will be named 'undefined'
  @::[name] = ->  # This will work; assigns to `A.prototype.method`
```
