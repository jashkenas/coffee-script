**CoffeeScript is a little language that compiles into JavaScript.** Underneath that awkward Java-esque patina, JavaScript has always had a gorgeous heart. CoffeeScript is an attempt to expose the good parts of JavaScript in a simple way.

The golden rule of CoffeeScript is: _“It’s just JavaScript.”_ The code compiles one-to-one into the equivalent JS, and there is no interpretation at runtime. You can use any existing JavaScript library seamlessly from CoffeeScript (and vice-versa). The compiled output is readable, pretty-printed, and tends to run as fast or faster than the equivalent handwritten JavaScript.

**CoffeeScript 2 is coming!** It adds support for [ES2015 classes](v2/#classes), [`async`/`await`](v2/#fat-arrow), and generates JavaScript using ES2015+ syntax. <a href="v2/">Learn more</a>.</p>
