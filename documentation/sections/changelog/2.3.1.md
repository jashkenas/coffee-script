*   Returning a JSX tag that is adjacent to another JSX tag, as opposed to returning a root JSX tag or fragment, is invalid JSX syntax. Babel throws an error on this, and now the CoffeeScript compiler does too.
*   Syntax cleanup: it is now possible for an implicit function call to take a body-less class as an argument, and `?::` now behaves identically to `::` with regard to implying a line continuation.
