--------------------------

comment comment

    test "basic literate CoffeeScript parsing", ->
      ok yes
      
now with a...
  
    test "broken up indentation", ->
    
... broken up ...

      do ->
      
... nested block.

        ok yes

Code must be separated from text by a blank line.

    test "code blocks must be preceded by a blank line", ->

The next line is part of the text and will not be executed.
      fail()

      ok yes        
        
Code in `backticks is not parsed` and...

    test "comments in indented blocks work", ->
      do ->
        do ->
          # Regular comment.
          
          ###
            Block comment.
          ###
          
          ok yes
          
Regular [Markdown](http://example.com/markdown) features, like links 
and unordered lists, are fine:

  * I 
  
  * Am
  
  * A
  
  * List

Tabs work too:

				test "tabbed code", ->
					ok yes

---

    # keep track of whether code blocks are executed or not
    executed = false

<p>

    executed = true # should not execute, this is just HTML para, not code!

</p>

    test "should ignore indented sections inside HTML", ->
      eq executed, false

---

*   A list item with a code block:

        test "basic literate CoffeeScript parsing", ->
          ok yes

---

*   Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.
    Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus. Vestibulum enim wisi,
    viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus.

*   Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit.
    Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.

1.  This is a list item with two paragraphs. Lorem ipsum dolor
    sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam hendrerit
    mi posuere lectus.

    Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet
    vitae, risus. Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum
    sit amet velit.

2.  Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.

This next one probably passes because a string is inoffensive in compiled js, also, can't get `marked` to parse it correctly, and not sure if empty line is permitted between title and reference
