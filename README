  CoffeeScript is a little language that compiles into JavaScript.

  Install Node.js, and then the CoffeeScript compiler:
  sudo bin/cake install

  Or, if you have the Node Package Manager installed:
  npm install -g coffee-script
  (Leave off the -g if you don't wish to install globally.)

  Execute a script:
  coffee /path/to/script.coffee

  Compile a script:
  coffee -c /path/to/script.coffee

  For documentation, usage, and examples, see:
  http://coffeescript.org/

  To suggest a feature, report a bug, or general discussion:
  http://github.com/jashkenas/coffee-script/issues/

  If you'd like to chat, drop by #coffeescript on Freenode IRC,
  or on webchat.freenode.net.

  The source repository:
  git://github.com/jashkenas/coffee-script.git

  All contributors are listed here:

  Windows Instructions

  Download windows node directly from the node.js website.  This is an command-line executable, not a self-extracting archive.  It muat be at least 0.5.7.  This is an "unstable" version, 
  but we know of no coffeescript related problems.  http://nodejs.org/dist/v0.5.7/node.exe

  git clone the source repository (git://github.com/jashkenas/coffee-script.git)

  The coffee command is in bin/coffee (there's no extension) relative to your current directory.

  From the same directory, run <<PATH TO NODE.EXE>> <<PATH TO BIN/COFFEE>> <<COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS>>.
  For instance, to compile a script as shown above:  ./node.exe ./bin/coffee -c /path/to/script.coffee
